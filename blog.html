        <p>How I Started Learning Web Development
It all started when I wanted to build my own personal website. At first, HTML looked like a foreign language filled with strange tags, but soon I realized it was like telling a computer how to arrange words and pictures on a page. CSS helped me add colors, layouts, and designs, and JavaScript made my site interactive.

The best part? You don’t need expensive tools—just a text editor and a browser. My advice to beginners is to start small, experiment daily, and never be afraid to break things. Every error is just a lesson in disguise.</p>

        <p>Why Consistency Beats Motivation
Motivation comes and goes, but consistency stays. Many people wait for the “right time” to start working on their goals, but in truth, the right time is now. Small daily actions compound into big results over time.

Whether it’s learning a skill, improving health, or building a project, progress is more about habits than sudden bursts of energy. Even on days you don’t feel like it, showing up and doing something—no matter how small—keeps the momentum alive.</p>
